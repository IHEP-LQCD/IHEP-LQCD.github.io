The main research interest of the collaboration is investigating the low energy strong interaction with lattice quantum chromodynamics (lattice QCD), which is one of the best-known methods to solve quantum field theories nonperturbatively.

The research areas including 
* spectroscopy and structure of hadrons, especially exotic hadrons such as glueballs, hybrids etc.
* renormalization of lattice operators.
* software development and numerical algorithm related studies, such as gauge configuration generation.
