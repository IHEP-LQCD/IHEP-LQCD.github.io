During the 31st International Symposium on Lepton Photon Interactions at High Energies hosted by Monash University in Melbourne ([https://indico.cern.ch/event/1114856](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1114856)), Prof. Ying Chen give a talk on "Lattice QCD developments in flavor physics".

To summarize, the main points are:
* Lattice QCD makes a rapid progress in the study of heavy flavor spectroscopy.
* Multiquark states are hot topics of lattice QCD studies.
* The existing lattice QCD results relevant to $$T_{cc}^+(3875)$$ are consistent with each other and support the existence of a shallow $$DD^*(I=0)$$ bound state.
* Similar studies are extended to the beauty counterpart $$T_{bb}$$ of $$T_{cc}$$,  and suggest the existence of a (deeply) bound $$I(J^P)=0(1^+)$$ $$BB^*$$ state.
* A deeply bound dibaryon $$\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$$ is predicted.
* There are also developments in the study of charmoniumlike resonance.
* The decay properties of charmoniumlike hybrid $$\eta_{c1}$$ are predicted by lattice QCD.
* More interesting works is underway.
